### Application of temperature and humidity sensor

**<span style="font-size:16px;">Project name：</span>**<span style="font-size:16px;">the application of temperature and humidity sensors</span>

**<span style="font-size:16px;">Specific requirements：</span>**<span style="font-size:16px;">collect the temperature and humidity sensor data displayed to the LCD screen</span>

**<span style="font-size:16px;">System design：</span>**<span style="font-size:16px;">IIC bus to send the configuration, configuration completed LCD; according to the timing sequence to complete the configuration of this sensor, the same use of IIC bus to transfer the data collected by the sensor to the LCD to complete the design.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">This design uses the temperature and humidity sensor that comes with the Aju expansion board, and the ports need to be fully corresponded to the development board when using it. As shown in the figure: the first line shows the indoor temperature, the second line shows the indoor relative humidity.</span>

**<span style="font-size:16px;">Implementation process：</span>**

<span style="font-size:16px;">

1 Connect the Ajou expansion board to the development board according to the interface.
  
2 Connect the LCD1602 to the development board.
  
3 Assign pins as required and download the program.
