### Perf-V based waveform generator

**<span style="font-size:16px;">Project name：</span>**<span style="font-size:16px;">Perf-V based waveform generator</span>

**<span style="font-size:16px;">Project Description：</span>**

<span style="font-size:16px;">

This module can be used with perf-v simple oscilloscope.

By storing waveform data in the ROM lookup table, four sets of waveforms are stored: sine, square, triangle, and delta, and each set of waveforms samples 4096 points in total. The output frequency is controlled by adjusting the step value, and the output is 10bit bit wide data, which is converted from parallel data to serial data by the DA FPGA driver, and then transferred to the DA module, which is converted to analog output. The DA module used in this project is TLC5615.

The initial frequency of the waveform generator output can be adjusted independently, and the waveform will start to show a slight jaggedness after increasing to 50 times of the initial frequency.

Press the K1 button on the core board to reset the waveform generator to its initial state.

Dipswitch SW1 to adjust the step value, increasing by 1 with each toggle.

Toggle dipswitch SW2 to adjust the waveform, changing the waveform with each toggle, cycling back and forth as follows

sine wave, square wave, triangle wave, and delta wave.

Toggle dipswitch SW3 to adjust the step value, decreasing by 1 with each toggle; AD module:

Use TLC5615 serial DA module.

<span style="font-size:16px;">

In the pop-up window, select the Bitstream file, which is normally filled automatically, or look for the .bit file in the project directory project_DDS.runs\impl_1 (i.e., the file generated in step 3)

<span style="font-size:16px;">

V. After connecting the DA module, check the waveform with an external oscilloscope

Connect the data input port (DI), serial clock port (SCK) and chip select port (CS) of the DA module to ports 1, 2 and 3 in the figure below using Dupont wires respectively (or plug them in directly)

<span style="font-size:16px;">

Connect the oscilloscope signal input to the AD module output port to view the waveform.

VI. Adjust the waveform and step value

Press the Key1 button on the core board to reset the waveform generator to the initial state.

Toggle the dipswitch SW1 to adjust the step value and increase it by 1 each time you toggle it.

Toggle dipswitch SW2 to adjust the waveform, and change the waveform with each toggle, in a reciprocal cycle, as follows

sine wave, square wave, triangle wave, and delta wave.

Toggle dipswitch SW1 to adjust the step value, decreasing by 1 with each toggle.
