### Gigabit Ethernet

**<span style="font-size:16px;">Project name：</span>**<span style="font-size:16px;">Gigabit Ethernet.</span>

**<span style="font-size:16px;">Specific requirements：</span>**<span style="font-size:16px;">Data transmission is done via Gigabit Ethernet.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">
  
A high-speed port to 2.54 interface adapter board is used in the design, and the detailed design is as follows

**<span style="font-size:16px;">Implementation process：</span>**

<span style="font-size:16px;">
1：Change the source MAC address in the code to the MAC address of your own computer. If you don't know the mac address of your PC network card, check it in the DOS command window with the ipconfig-all command.

<span style="font-size:16px;">
2：The Ethernet module is connected to the development board through an adapter board, and the pin assignment is as follows after connection.

<span style="font-size:16px;">
3：Modify the IP address of the PC to 192.168.0.2. The IP address of the PC needs to be the same as the one set in the transmitter module (ipsend.v), otherwise the PC will not receive the UDP packets sent by the development board. Of course, the user can also change the target IP address in the code.

<span style="font-size:16px;">
4:In the DOS command window to bind the IP address and MAC address of the development board, (because the test project does not support ARP protocol, so only through this IP and MAC binding to force the development board IP address and MAC address associated together, so that when the PC sends a packet to 192.168.0.3, the target MAC address is automatically the development board's (MAC address.)

Run the command：arp - s 192.168.0.3 ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff

View command：arp -a

<span style="font-size:16px;">
5:Install the network packet capture tool Wireshark, we can use this tool to view the data sent and received by the PC network port during the experiment.
  
6:Open the packet capture tool after the project is off the board, select the packet capture interface. (Select the last one)

<span style="font-size:16px;">
7：Start grabbing packets, you can see the data captured and the number of programs sent consistent.
