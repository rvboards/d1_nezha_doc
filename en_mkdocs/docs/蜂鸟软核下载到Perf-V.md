### Download Hummingbird Softcore to Perf-V

**<span style="font-size:16px;">Note: This example uses 2017.4.1 as an example to illustrate how to use it, the version is different but the usage is the same.</span>**

<span style="font-size:16px;">The Hummingbird project file has been ported to Perf-V for user convenience.</span>

<span style="font-szie:16px;">Copy the project file of Hummingbird from the company's file (in the folder named "Hummingbird Project") to the plain English directory (Vivado project does not support Chinese path).</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">Open Vivado 2017.4 again, as shown in the figure.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">Open "open Project". find the location where you store your Hummingbird project as shown in the figure.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">Open the project file as shown here.</span>

![](https://rvboards.org/rvboards/dasdu8syrbgvtzvhfj12f4d5/images_dir/1627372184/19.png)

<span style="font-size:16px;">Connect the downloader provided by the company to the JTAG port (note that it is not USERJTAG). The connection diagram is as follows.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">After connecting, turn on the board power switch and click on open Hardware Manager as shown in the figure.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">Click open target and then click Auto connect to automatically connect the downloader as shown in the figure.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">Then click Program device as shown in the figure.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">If the file in the path is the bit file path of the project, click program to complete the download. If not, please change the path to the project's bit file.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">This step completes the downloading of the Hummingbird project to Perf-V, but since the bit file just downloaded will be lost when the FPGA is powered down, once the development board is powered down, the program disappears and needs to be downloaded again, so for convenience you can continue with the steps to solidify the Hummingbird file into flash, which will not be lost even if it is powered down. Next is the tutorial for curing the Hummingbird project to flash.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">Open the project directory project\project_1.runs\impl_1 and search for the bit file system.bit. Copy this file to the root directory of the D drive. First, copy the system.bit generated by the project (if you cannot find it, search for the file name in the project file) to the root directory of the D drive. Then copy this command:
  
	"write_cfgmem -format mcs -interface spix4 -size 128 -loadbit "up 0x0 
  
	D:/system.bit" -force D:/system.mcs"
  
to Vivado's command box, as shown in the figure.

<span style="font-size:16px;">
If the bit file is generated into mcs file successfully, please check the path again. If it fails, most of the paths are wrong, please check the paths again.

Next, right click on xc7a35t_0 in the above figure and select add configuration memory device as shown in the figure.

In search, type: n25q64

Select n25q64-3.3v as shown in the figure.

<span style="font-size:16px;">In the configuration file, select the mcs file you just created in the root directory of the D drive. Click OK again to solidify the Hummingbird project into flash. It will not be lost when power is lost.</span>
